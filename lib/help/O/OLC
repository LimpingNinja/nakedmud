  On-Line Creation (OLC) is a set of utilities designed to allow builders to
  design their zones while on the MUD. OLC includes utilities for editing zones,
  rooms, objects, mobiles, triggers, and dialogues. The following commands are
  available to the online builder:
  
        content              edit                    list                    reload
        rooms                redit                   rlist <zone key>        rreload
        objects              oedit                   olist <zone key>        oreload
        mobiles              medit                   mlist <zone key>        mreload
        triggers             tedit                   tlist <zone key>
        dialogs              dedit                   dlist <zone key>
        socials              socedit                 socials
        zones                zedit                   zlist
  
  Additional utility commands include delete commands (rdelete, mdelete, odelete,
  tdelete, ddelete) and the load command for instantiating prototypes.
  
  To create a new zone, a special command must be used. It's format is:
    zedit new <zone key> 
  
  All other OLC commands can set up new things (rooms, objects, mobiles, etc..)
  simply by using the corresponding edit command on a key that has not been used.
