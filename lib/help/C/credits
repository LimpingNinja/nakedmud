  This is a continuation of NakedMud(tm) created in order to finish the work
  of after the passing of Geoff Hollis in polishing up the codebase, modernizing it 
  with Python 3+ and refining the Python integration, as well as providing some new
  functionality.

  Thanks go out to Brian Graversen for creating SocketMud(tm), which NakedMud(tm)
  was built on top of. I know nothing (yet) about TCP/IP, and SocketMud(tm) made 
  my life that much easier.
