  {WNAKED{nMUD 4.1 - Credits and Acknowledgments
  
  NakedMud was originally created by {WGeoff Hollis{n (1979-2021) beginning around
  2003-2004 as an innovative Python-integrated MUD server. Development continues
  under {WKevin Morgan (LimpingNinja){n to honor Geoff's work and vision.

  {WIn Memory of Geoff Hollis{n
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Geoff was not just a brilliant programmer, but a warm and encouraging mentor
  who challenged others to push boundaries. His work on NakedMud, developed during
  his graduate studies, demonstrated his ability to blend technical excellence with
  innovative game design. Through our conversations about game theory, linguistics,
  and technical challenges, Geoff influenced many to pursue game development and
  explore the psychological aspects of how we develop, play, and learn. His impact
  on careers and lives extends far beyond the code he wrote. He will always be
  remembered for his generosity, brilliance, and the doors he opened for others.

  {WORIGINAL CREDITS{n from Geoff Hollis:
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
  Thanks go out to {WBrian Graversen{n for creating SocketMud(tm), which NakedMud(tm)
  was built on top of. I know nothing (yet) about TCP/IP, and SocketMud(tm) made 
  my life that much easier.
  
  Additional thanks to {WErwin Andreasen{n for the code snippets that were
  incorporated into SocketMud and subsequently into NakedMud.
