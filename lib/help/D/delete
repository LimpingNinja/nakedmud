  As a builder, you may at times create rooms, objects, mobiles, triggers,
  help files, etc... that you do not want to be part of your zone. You can
  delete these things with the line of delete functions available. There should
  be one for each major type of editable content. When deleting rooms, anyone
  in the room will be removed from the game, and sockets will be disconnected.
