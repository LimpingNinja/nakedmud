  Please see help OLC for all available commands.
  
  As a builder, you may need to reload prototypes and files from disk to update
  their in-memory cache and optionally replace live instances. Reload commands
  allow you to refresh content after it has been modified externally. This is
  useful when files are edited outside the MUD or when you want to revert
  changes made in editors.
  
  RELOAD COMMAND DETAILS:
  
  rreload <room>
    Reloads a room prototype from disk and replaces the live room instance.
    The room is immediately updated with new descriptions, exits, and settings.
    Any players or objects in the room remain but see the updated environment.
    
    Syntax: rreload <room_key>
    Example: rreload tavern
    
  mreload <mobile> [room|all]
    Reloads a mobile prototype from disk and optionally replaces live instances.
    Equipment and inventory are preserved during replacement.
    
    Options:
      room (default) - Replace mobile instances in current room only
      all           - Replace all mobile instances across the entire MUD
    
    Syntax: mreload <mobile_key> [room|all]
    Examples:
      mreload guard         - Reload guard mproto, replace instances in room
      mreload guard room    - Same as above (explicit)
      mreload guard all     - Reload guard mproto, replace all instances in MUD
      mreload guard@zone    - Full zone specification
    
  oreload <object> [room|all]
    Reloads an object prototype from disk and optionally replaces live instances.
    Container contents and furniture items are preserved during replacement.
    
    Options:
      room (default) - Replace object instances in current room only
      all           - Replace all object instances across the entire MUD
    
    Syntax: oreload <object_key> [room|all]
    Examples:

      oreload bag@zone      - Full zone specification
    
  hreload <help>
    Reloads a help file from disk, updating the in-memory help system.
    No live instances to replace - help files are pure data.
    
    Syntax: hreload <help_keyword>
    Examples:
      hreload OLC           - Reload OLC help file from disk
      hreload reload        - Reload this help file from disk
      hreload edit          - Reload edit help file from disk
  
  IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - rreload has no room/all options - it always replaces the single room instance
  - mreload and oreload support room/all options for instance replacement control
  - hreload has no options - it simply reloads the help file data
  - All reload commands preserve existing relationships (equipment, contents, etc.)
  - Reload commands require builder permissions and zone edit access
