  Please see help OLC for all available commands.
  
  As a builder, you can view all prototypes of a specific type within a zone
  using the list commands. These commands display all available content for
  editing and reference. There is a list command for each major type of
  zone content.
  
  list commands are: rlist, mlist, olist, tlist, dlist, and zlist. Syntax
  is as follows:
    <list command> <zone key>
  
  The zone list command (zlist) does not require a zone argument and shows
  all available zones.
  
  Examples:
    rlist fooland    - List all room prototypes in the fooland zone
    mlist fooland    - List all mobile prototypes in the fooland zone
    olist fooland    - List all object prototypes in the fooland zone
    tlist fooland    - List all trigger prototypes in the fooland zone
    dlist fooland    - List all dialog prototypes in the fooland zone
    zlist            - List all zones
