  Please see help OLC for all available commands.
  
  As a builder, you can instantiate prototypes directly into the game world
  using the load command. This command creates live instances of mobile and
  object prototypes for testing and placement purposes.
  
  Syntax: load <type> <reference>
  
  The type can be either 'mobile' or 'object' (or abbreviated forms like
  'mob' and 'obj'). The reference follows standard prototype naming conventions
  and can include zone specifications.
  
  Examples:
    load mobile guard        - Create a guard mobile in your current room
    load mob town_guard      - Same as above (abbreviated)
    load object sword        - Create a sword object in your inventory
    load obj torch@fooland   - Create a torch from the fooland zone
  
  The command will fail if:
    - The prototype does not exist
    - The prototype is marked as abstract
    - There is an error running the prototype script
  
  Loaded mobiles appear in your current room, while loaded objects are
  placed in your inventory.
