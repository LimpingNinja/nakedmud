## History

NakedMud was originally created by **Geoff Hollis** (1979-2021) beginning around 2003-2004 as a content-less MUD engine built upon SocketMud by Brian Graversen. Geoff developed NakedMud during his graduate studies, creating an innovative Python-integrated MUD server that emphasized modularity and extensibility.

After Geoff's passing in November 2021, development was continued by **Kevin Morgan (LimpingNinja)** to honor his work and vision, focusing on modernizing the codebase for Python 3+ compatibility while preserving the original design philosophy.
