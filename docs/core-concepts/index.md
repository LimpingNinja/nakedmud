# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and systems that form the foundation of NakedMud development. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective mud building and module development.

## Overview

NakedMud is built around several key architectural concepts that enable flexible, modular development:

- **[Auxiliary Data System](auxiliary-data.md)** - Extensible data attachment system for game objects
- **[Prototype System](prototypes.md)** - Template-based object creation with inheritance
- **[Python Integration Overview](python-integration.md)** - How C and Python components interact
- **[Security Model](security-model.md)** - Safe scripting environment and restrictions
- **[Scripting Best Practices](scripting-best-practices.md)** - Guidelines for effective script development

## Getting Started

If you're new to NakedMud development, we recommend reading these concepts in order:

1. **Auxiliary Data System** - Learn how to extend game objects with custom data
2. **Prototype System** - Understand template-based content creation
3. **Python Integration Overview** - Explore how C and Python work together
4. **Security Model** - Understand the safe scripting environment
5. **Scripting Best Practices** - Learn effective development techniques

Each concept builds upon the previous ones, providing a comprehensive understanding of NakedMud's architecture.

## Key Benefits

These systems work together to provide:

- **Modularity** - Keep code organized and maintainable
- **Extensibility** - Add new features without modifying core code
- **Flexibility** - Support diverse gameplay mechanics
- **Security** - Safe scripting environment for user content
- **Performance** - Efficient C core with Python scripting layer

## Next Steps

After understanding these core concepts, you can:

- Explore the [Reference Documentation](../reference/) for detailed API information
- Follow [Tutorials](../tutorials/) for hands-on learning
- Study [Examples](../examples/) of real-world implementations
