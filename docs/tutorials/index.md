# Tutorials

Step-by-step guides for common NakedMud development tasks. These tutorials provide practical, hands-on experience with the Python library through real-world examples.

## Learning Path

We recommend following tutorials in this order:

1. **Start with the Basics**: Complete the beginner tutorials to understand fundamental concepts
2. **Build Complexity**: Move to intermediate tutorials to learn advanced patterns
3. **Create Systems**: Use advanced tutorials to build complete game systems

## Tutorial Categories

### Start with the Basics
Perfect for those new to NakedMud Python scripting:

- **[Getting Started with Python Scripting](getting-started-scripting/)** - Learn the fundamentals of Python scripting in NakedMud
- **[Your First NPC](your-first-npc/)** - Build your first non-player character with basic behaviors
- **[Building Your First Room](building-your-first-room/)** - Create interactive room environments
- **[Basic Triggers and Scripts](basic-triggers-scripts/)** - Learn event-driven behaviors using triggers

### Build Complexity
For developers ready to tackle more complex scenarios:

- **[Advanced NPC Behaviors](advanced-npc-behaviors/)** - Build NPCs with sophisticated AI and interactions
- **[Complex Room Interactions](complex-room-interactions/)** - Create sophisticated environmental systems
- **[Object Scripting and Item Types](object-scripting-item-types/)** - Add advanced functionality to items and objects
- **[Using the Event System](using-event-system/)** - Master the event system for timed actions

### Create Systems
Deep dives into complex systems and patterns:

- **Quest System Development** - Build complete quest mechanics (Coming Soon)
- **Combat System Creation** - Implement custom combat rules (Coming Soon)
- **Shop and Economy Systems** - Create player-driven economies (Coming Soon)

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview**: What you'll build and learn
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge and setup
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed implementation guide
- **Code Examples**: Complete, working code samples
- **Testing**: How to verify your implementation
- **Extensions**: Ideas for expanding the tutorial
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should:

- Complete the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) section
- Understand [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/) like auxiliary data and prototypes
- Have access to a working NakedMud installation
- Be comfortable with basic Python programming

## Code Examples

All tutorial code is:
- **Complete**: Ready to run without modification
- **Commented**: Thoroughly explained with inline comments
- **Tested**: Verified to work in actual mud environments
- **Extensible**: Designed to be modified and expanded

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Check the Code**: Ensure you've copied examples exactly
2. **Review Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the required knowledge
3. **Consult the Reference**: Look up specific functions in the [API Reference](/reference/)
4. **Read Core Concepts**: Review relevant [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/) for deeper understanding
