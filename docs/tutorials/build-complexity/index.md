# Build Complexity

For developers ready to tackle more complex scenarios. These tutorials build on the basics to create sophisticated systems and advanced behaviors.

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced NPC AI systems with memory and emotions
- Complex environmental systems and room interactions
- Sophisticated object scripting and item types
- Event-driven programming with the event system
- Performance optimization techniques
- Advanced scripting patterns and best practices

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should have:

- Completed all tutorials in [Start with the Basics](../start-with-basics/)
- Solid understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with NakedMud's core systems
- Experience with the OLC system and triggers

## Tutorial Order

These tutorials can be taken in any order, but we recommend:

1. **[Advanced NPC Behaviors](../advanced-npc-behaviors/)** - Sophisticated AI systems
2. **[Complex Room Interactions](../complex-room-interactions/)** - Environmental systems
3. **[Object Scripting and Item Types](../object-scripting-item-types/)** - Interactive objects
4. **[Using the Event System](../using-event-system/)** - Timed and scheduled actions

## Advanced Concepts Covered

- **State Management**: Complex object and character states
- **Memory Systems**: NPCs that remember interactions
- **Emotional AI**: NPCs with dynamic emotional responses
- **Environmental Systems**: Weather, hazards, and atmospheric effects
- **Object Networks**: Items that interact with each other
- **Event Scheduling**: Complex timing and scheduling systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient scripting techniques

## Skills You'll Develop

- Creating reusable scripting frameworks
- Implementing complex game mechanics
- Optimizing performance for large systems
- Debugging advanced scripting issues
- Following best practices for maintainable code
