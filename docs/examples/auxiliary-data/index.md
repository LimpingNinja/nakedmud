# Auxiliary Data Examples

Complete examples demonstrating advanced auxiliary data usage patterns. These examples show sophisticated techniques for managing complex game data.

## Available Examples

### [Guild System](guild-system/)
Complete guild management system with member relationships, hierarchies, and persistent data.

### [Character Skill Trees](skill-trees/)
Hierarchical skill progression system with experience tracking and ability unlocks.

### [Adaptive NPC Behavior](adaptive-npc/)
NPCs that learn and adapt their behavior based on player interactions.

### [Multi-Level Caching](caching-system/)
Performance optimization through sophisticated caching strategies.

### [Data Validation](validation-system/)
Schema-based validation system for ensuring data integrity.

## Common Patterns Demonstrated

### Proper Auxiliary Data Usage
- Using the auxiliary data API correctly (not JSON strings everywhere)
- Proper data lifecycle management
- Performance considerations

### Data Relationships
- Creating connections between different auxiliary data sets
- Managing complex data hierarchies
- Maintaining data consistency

### Performance Optimization
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading expensive operations
- Memory management techniques

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when data is missing
- Validation and sanitization
- Recovery from corrupted data

## Integration Guidelines

### Using These Examples
1. Study the complete example code
2. Understand the data structures used
3. Adapt the patterns for your specific needs
4. Test thoroughly in your environment

### Best Practices
- Always validate auxiliary data before use
- Handle missing or corrupted data gracefully
- Use appropriate data types for your needs
- Document your data structures clearly

### Performance Considerations
- Auxiliary data is loaded with objects
- Large data structures impact memory usage
- Consider lazy loading for expensive data
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
